Hi all,
 
As most of you know you have interviews for a testing role at the Home Office. So with that being said I know you all have different skill sets so I’m going to give you a couple of tasks to do to get ready  as well as having a mock interview with you on the 12th.
 
As for the tasks, I would like you all to have a look at creating a test using Selenium and Junit on the Auto trader website. What I would like this test to do is to take some input data and search Auto trader for that data. i.e. If the input data was Make: Aston Martin and Model:DB5 your test would be able to go on the website and do a search. I would a link to a GitHub with this project in by Tuesday morning so I can give you some pointers on anything for you to work on.
 
The other task I would like you to do is to do some research on Jmeter, Cucumber, Postman, and JSON in terms of tech and Jira,Confluence,Bitbucket,Nexus and Jenkins in terms of tools.
 
If you guys have any issues or questions please don’t hesitate to email or ring me anytime including over the weekend.
 
Finally can you all email me a time that you would like your interview on Tuesday this will be on a first come first served basis.
 
Thanks
 
Ashley
